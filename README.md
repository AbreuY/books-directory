For this project, I'm going to build a book directory, where I would need to create endpoints, using the four most basic methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

I’d use GET for getting all books or getting only one book by id. With the POST method, I can add a new book to the list. I’d need the PUT method for updating the existing book, and it’s evident that with the DELETE method, I will remove the book from the list. 

For this kind of application, I can use a datbase or can start with data collected as a JSON file.
